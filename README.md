# apple-picker


Hello this is Chirstopher Bruces apple picker... It for the most part works, the score boards are there but don't function cause when I tried to turn them on the thing would start
throwing errors. Branches send an end game. but are not uncommen despit what should only exist below 0.001. The tree putters along with the apples. The Baskets have to use a and d and < > to function because the mouse made them stack up on each other.


Things to do better: 
Time managment/ make sure your other classes are not assigning 15 hws on the one weekend you plan on working this through

Get started eariler so you can ask teacher the random errors you find and how to fixe them.

Things that went well
Fallowing the book was realtivly easy

Learning C# is not a much as a pain as I thought it would be

THe funny
The reason why Apple has a  sript to delet the tree if it gose below a point is because it somehow got bugged and would fall off depsit having no gravity

Also at one point my apples litterly didn't spawn on the tree, they came like 4 unties to tghe left because the tree object was telling it that is center was there despit the bodie being to the left because when I made the tree I moved the bottom and the top out of the way so that effected things.

Anyway I tried my best under the current conditions.
