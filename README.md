# apple-picker


Hello, this is Christopher Bruces apple picker... It for the most part works, the scoreboards are there but don't function cause when I tried to turn them on the thing would start
throwing errors. Branches send an end game. But they are not uncommon despite what should only exist below 0.001. The tree putters along with the apples. The Baskets have to use a and d and < > to function because the mouse made them stack up on each other.


Things to do better: 
Time management/ make sure your other classes are not assigning 15 homework assignments on the one weekend you plan on working this through

Get started earlier so you can ask the teacher about the random errors you find and how to fix them.

Things that went well
Following the book was relatively easy.

Learning C# is not as much of a pain as I thought it would be

The funny
The reason why Apple has a function to delete the tree if it goes below a point is that it somehow got bugged and would fall off despite having no gravity.

Also at one point, my apples didn't spawn on the tree, they came like 4 unties to the left because the tree object was telling it that its center was there despite the body being to the left because when I made the tree I moved the bottom and the top out of the way so that affected things.

Anyway, I think I tried my best under the current conditions.
